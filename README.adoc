= DotenvSecrets

`dotenv_secrets` is a simple utility that allows you to read from dotenv-formatted secrets files without populating env vars with those secrets. This is good because 3rd party integrations, loggers--all kinds of stuff frankly--can ship your entire `ENV` constant somewhere, and if you had secrets in environment variables, well they're not secret anymore.

== Goals

* Make it easy (if not as performant) to read from dotenv files without populating `ENV`
* Never keep the contents of the dotenv-formatted file in memory past one GC run

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dotenv_secrets'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
$ gem install dotenv_secrets
```

== Usage

It's really simple:

```ruby
secrets = DotenvSecrets.new(path: "/tmp/secrets.env") # many cloud providers /tmp dir is a ramdisk,
                                                      # so your secrets never get to written to
                                                      # disk if they're provisioned in /tmp/

secrets["SOME_SERVICE_API_KEY"] # => whatever value was stored directly after SOME_SERVICE_API_KEY=

secrets["NOT_IN_THE_FILE"] # => raises an EOFError
```

That's it!

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to link:https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
